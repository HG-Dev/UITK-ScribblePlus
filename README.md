**UITK-Scribble** is a sample project for Unity UI Toolkit implementing a custom control with simple drawing features.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Unity 6 (6000.0 or later)

Notes
-----

- The `Scribble` UI control needs the `ScribbleBackend` component to provide the drawing features.
  It should be added to the game object holding the `UIDocument` component.
